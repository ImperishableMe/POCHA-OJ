  ## Installation Process

  Open the terminal and create a virtual environment.
  Run the following command:
  ```
  $ pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

  The project uses background_task for processing the submissions. So, open a new terminal in the same directory where `manage.py` is and activate the virtual environment. 
  Run the following command :
  ```
  $ python manage.py process_tasks
  ```

  You should be good to go :D
